 *  This was meant to be an extremely lightweight platform for registering
 *  callbacks and triggering those callbacks.  It was not meant to provide
 *  the many features of other options, but really meant as an extremely
 *  low footprint option for triggering a callback based on an event in
 *  your system.  It can also be used for simple communication between
 *  your components, although this should generally be done following the
 *  react design guidelines.
